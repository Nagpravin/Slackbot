This whole operation is running on Python, using the Slack Bolt Framework to manage the chat commands that's the "glue" that lets it talk to Slack. For storing all your processed keywords, clusters and outlines so nothing gets lost, we're using Supabase as the database. To generate those clever outlines, the bot needs to check the web, so it uses DuckDuckGo Search for quick info. Finally, the polish comes from ReportLab, which takes all the results and formats them into a nice, clean, downloadable PDF report.

If you want to run this locally, the process is pretty straightforward. After cloning the repo and installing the dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, the most important step is setting up a simple .env file. This file is basically the bot's secret address book, holding the keys for Slack and Supabase so it can connect to everything securely. Once those secrets are in place, you just run python app.py.

Once the bot is running on your computer, you'll need a tool like ngrok to create a secure tunnel so Slack can find your local setup. After you point your Slack app's slash commands to that public ngrok URL, you're good to go! You can use /upload_keywords to start the cycle, /generate_outline to create the ideas and outlines and finally /generate_report to get that detailed PDF report right in your chat. That's the whole workflow!
